<p>Only include content that is likely to be sought out/attractive, valued and read by the audience. Don’t include content for the sake of having a larger site or simply because you can you will be creating a massive maintenance overhead. Remember users are mostly time poor and have a specific goal in mind. In most cases only job applicants &amp; the competition will pore over your site. If you are working on a company website, don’t get carried away with what you can do or what would be cool, but constantly do a cost-benefit analysis in your head and focus on delivering value to your employer</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-wordsphrases">Choice of Words/Phrases</h2>
<p>Bear in mind that titles seen as content at the top of pages should correspond to: the title meta tag of that page; the URL for the specific page to an extent; and the wording of the link (or navigational button) that was clicked. This all goes towards assuring the user they are where they wanted to be and helps them get there again</p>
<p>Do not simply replicate a company’s internal structure in your site map just because it is recognised and useful internally, does not guarantee your users will know how or where to start</p>
<p>Think about what you want the target audience to be able to do or what it wants to do, and what words they would be looking for to carry out that task</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Try to make your main site navigation positioning, design and ordering consistent throughout. Your home page is often the lesson users take away with them on how your site is structured if you change it after the home page I have observed users become blind to new or different navigation further in</p>
<p>_<strong>Do not have a set of navigational links that is any larger than 8 item</strong>_s users are put off when overwhelmed with choice. Divide your navigation into chunks a typical way to do this is by using design to separate general utilities like contact us, site help, site map, etc. from key content areas</p>
<p>Try not to place key navigation (content and utilities) that appears on all pages in different areas of the page e.g. left, top right and bottom the more you do this the more invisible it can become to the user</p>
<p><em>Avoid placing important navigation at the top. While scanning pages, which is the way the huge majority of web users use the Internet, they blank out anything they don’t recognise, know they don’t want or that looks like advertising – which they have come to expect in the top part of the page</em></p>
<p>Place legals (copyright notice, privacy policy, terms and conditions) at the bottom of all web pages where they are typically found, but you should also draw them to users’ attention by including links within content where it is timely for them to be read.</p>
<p>help users find what they want within a list of links. <strong>Items should be listed alphabetically</strong> unless there is a natural order that 90% of users would grasp with ease when looking for a specific item</p>
<p><em>If the subject matter lends itself to such manipulation, place what you want users to notice and remember for a long period at the top</em>. Place links you want users to remember for a short time at the bottom of the navigational set and remember that unless middle items have some special significance to the user they won’t be remembered at all</p>
<p>Do not focus on the number of clicks rather than usability. <strong>It is more important that users feel in control and understand what to click on, than to ensure all info is 3 clicks away.</strong> Don’t bury it too deep either but definitely don’t create a contrived unfathomable navigation to meet some dumb web rule</p>
<p><strong>Treat text links repeating primary navigation at the end of each page as an optional extra.</strong></p>
<h4 id="include-a-search-and-site-map-note-that-some-users-have-learned-searching-gets-them-to-the-info-they-seek-quicker-than-browsing-and-look-for-a-search-box-rather-than-at-navigation-as-soon-as-they-come-to-a-new-website"><strong>Include a search and site map</strong>!! Note that some users have learned searching gets them to the info they seek quicker than browsing and look for a search box, rather than at navigation, as soon as they come to a new website</h4>
<p><strong>Planning the In-Page Navigation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choice of Words/Phrases</strong></p>
<p>Do not make phrases such as ‘click here’, ‘buy now’ or ‘more info’ lone links</p>
<p>Instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Click here for the latest company news’ becomes ‘Latest company news’</li>
<li>‘Buy now’ becomes ‘Buy 4 socket extension cable now’</li>
<li>‘More info’ becomes ‘More info on our product range’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p><em>Have a simple site, plan to include a ‘You are here’ navigation before the page title (i.e. show the user where they are in the site). Also show what step they’re on of how many, in stepped interactions such as making a purchase</em></p>
<p><strong>If you have an image associated with a text link, make the image a link too most users expect to be able to click on the image</strong></p>
<p><em>Minimise the amount of links on the page keep it under 20</em></p>
<p><em>Limit the user’s key choices of what to do next to a max of 4 options but preferably less if you can</em></p>
<p><em>When a user is engaging in a purchase or some other activity you do not want them distracted from, consider using a different main navigation bar which has less options but still allows them to get back to home</em></p>
