## Giving the right name

<span class="task__importance" title="How important is the task, from 1 to 5">importance: 3</span>

1.  Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
2.  Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

solution

The variable for our planet

#### The variable for our planet

That’s simple:

    let ourPlanetName = "Earth";

Note, we could use a shorter name `planet`, but it might not be obvious what planet it refers to. It’s nice to be more verbose. At least until the variable isNotTooLong.

The name of the current visitor

#### The name of the current visitor

    let currentUserName = "John";

Again, we could shorten that to `userName` if we know for sure that the user is current.

Modern editors and autocomplete make long variable names easy to write. Don’t save on them. A name with 3 words in it is fine.

And if your editor does not have proper autocompletion, get [a new one](../code-editors.html).
