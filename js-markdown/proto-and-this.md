## Where does it write?

We have `rabbit` inheriting from `animal`.

If we call `rabbit.eat()`, which object receives the `full` property: `animal` or `rabbit`?

    let animal = {
      eat() {
        this.full = true;
      }
    };

    let rabbit = {
      __proto__: animal
    };

    rabbit.eat();

solution

**The answer: `rabbit`.**

Thatâ€™s because `this` is an object before the dot, so `rabbit.eat()` modifies `rabbit`.

Property lookup and execution are two different things.

The method `rabbit.eat` is first found in the prototype, then executed with `this=rabbit`.
