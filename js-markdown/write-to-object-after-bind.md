## Bound function as a method

<span class="task__importance" title="How important is the task, from 1 to 5">importance: 5</span>

What will be the output?

    function f() {
      alert( this ); // ?
    }

    let user = {
      g: f.bind(null)
    };

    user.g();

solution

The answer: `null`.

<a href="write-to-object-after-bind.html#"
<a href="write-to-object-after-bind.html#" class="toolbar__button toolbar__button_edit" title="open in sandbox"></a>

    function f() {
      alert( this ); // null
    }

    let user = {
      g: f.bind(null)
    };

    user.g();

The context of a bound function is hard-fixed. Thereâ€™s just no way to further change it.

So even while we run `user.g()`, the original function is called with `this=null`.
