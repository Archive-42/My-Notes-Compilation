## Rewrite 'if' into '?'

<span class="task__importance" title="How important is the task, from 1 to 5">importance: 5</span>

Rewrite this `if` using the conditional operator `'?'`:

    let result;

    if (a + b < 4) {
      result = 'Below';
    } else {
      result = 'Over';
    }

solution

    let result = (a + b < 4) ? 'Below' : 'Over';
