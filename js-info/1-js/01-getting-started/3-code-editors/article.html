<h1 id="code-editors">Code editors</h1>
<p>A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.</p>
<p>There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.</p>
<h2 id="ide">IDE</h2>
<p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a “whole project.” As the name suggests, it’s not just an editor, but a full-scale “development environment.”</p>
<p>An IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version management system (like <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>), a testing environment, and other “project-level” stuff.</p>
<p>If you haven’t selected an IDE yet, consider the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (cross-platform, free).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> (cross-platform, paid).</li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows, there’s also “Visual Studio”, not to be confused with “Visual Studio Code”. “Visual Studio” is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform. It’s also good at JavaScript. There’s also a free version <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio Community</a>.</p>
<p>Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer’s salary, so just choose the best one for you.</p>
<h2 id="lightweight-editors">Lightweight editors</h2>
<p>“Lightweight editors” are not as powerful as IDEs, but they’re fast, elegant and simple.</p>
<p>They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.</p>
<p>The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.</p>
<p>In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there’s no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.</p>
<p>The following options deserve your attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> (cross-platform, free).</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (cross-platform, free).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> (cross-platform, shareware).</li>
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (Windows, free).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> are also cool if you know how to use them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-not-argue">Let’s not argue</h2>
<p>The editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends whom I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.</p>
<p>There are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.</p>
<p>The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.</p>
