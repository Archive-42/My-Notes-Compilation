    <h1 id="resumable-file-upload">Resumable file upload</h1>
    <p>With <code>fetch</code> method it’s fairly easy to upload a file.</p>
    <p>
      How to resume the upload after lost connection? There’s no built-in option
      for that, but we have the pieces to implement it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resumable uploads should come with upload progress indication, as we
      expect big files (if we may need to resume). So, as
      <code>fetch</code> doesn’t allow to track upload progress, we’ll use
      <a href="info:xmlhttprequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="not-so-useful-progress-event">Not-so-useful progress event</h2>
    <p>
      To resume upload, we need to know how much was uploaded till the
      connection was lost.
    </p>
    <p>There’s <code>xhr.upload.onprogress</code> to track upload progress.</p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, it won’t help us to resume the upload here, as it triggers
      when the data is <em>sent</em>, but was it received by the server? The
      browser doesn’t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it was buffered by a local network proxy, or maybe the remote server
      process just died and couldn’t process them, or it was just lost in the
      middle and didn’t reach the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>That’s why this event is only useful to show a nice progress bar.</p>
    <p>
      To resume upload, we need to know <em>exactly</em> the number of bytes
      received by the server. And only the server can tell that, so we’ll make
      an additional request.
    </p>
    <h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          First, create a file id, to uniquely identify the file we’re going to
          upload:
          <code
            >js let fileId = file.name + '-' + file.size + '-' +
            file.lastModified;</code
          >
          That’s needed for resume upload, to tell the server what we’re
          resuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the name or the size or the last modification date changes, then
          there’ll be another <code>fileId</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Send a request to the server, asking how many bytes it already has,
          like this: ```js let response = await fetch(‘status’, { headers: {
          ‘X-File-Id’: fileId } });
        </p>
        <p>
          // The server has that many bytes let startByte = +await
          response.text(); ```
        </p>
        <p>
          This assumes that the server tracks file uploads by
          <code>X-File-Id</code> header. Should be implemented at server-side.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the file doesn’t yet exist at the server, then the server response
          should be <code>0</code>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then, we can use <code>Blob</code> method <code>slice</code> to send
          the file from <code>startByte</code>: ```js xhr.open(“POST”, “upload”,
          true);
        </p>
        <p>
          // File id, so that the server knows which file we upload
          xhr.setRequestHeader(‘X-File-Id’, fileId);
        </p>
        <p>
          // The byte we’re resuming from, so the server knows we’re resuming
          xhr.setRequestHeader(‘X-Start-Byte’, startByte);
        </p>
        <p>
          xhr.upload.onprogress = (e) =&gt; { console.log(<code
            >Uploaded ${startByte + e.loaded} of ${startByte + e.total}</code
          >); };
        </p>
        <p>
          // file can be from input.files[0] or another source
          xhr.send(file.slice(startByte)); ```
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we send the server both file id as <code>X-File-Id</code>, so it
          knows which file we’re uploading, and the starting byte as
          <code>X-Start-Byte</code>, so it knows we’re not uploading it
          initially, but resuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server should check its records, and if there was an upload of
          that file, and the current uploaded size is exactly
          <code>X-Start-Byte</code>, then append the data to it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here’s the demo with both client and server code, written on Node.js.</p>
    <p>
      It works only partially on this site, as Node.js is behind another server
      named Nginx, that buffers uploads, passing them to Node.js when fully
      complete.
    </p>
    <p>But you can download it and run locally for the full demonstration:</p>
    <p>[codetabs src=“upload-resume” height=200]</p>
    <p>
      As we can see, modern networking methods are close to file managers in
      their capabilities – control over headers, progress indicator, sending
      file parts, etc.
    </p>
    <p>We can implement resumable upload and much more.</p>
