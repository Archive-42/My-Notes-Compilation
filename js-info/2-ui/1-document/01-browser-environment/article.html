    <h1 id="browser-environment-specs">Browser environment, specs</h1>
    <p>
      The JavaScript language was initially created for web browsers. Since then
      it has evolved and become a language with many uses and platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A platform may be a browser, or a web-server or another <em>host</em>,
      even a “smart” coffee machine, if it can run JavaScript. Each of them
      provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript specification
      calls that a <em>host environment</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A host environment provides own objects and functions additional to the
      language core. Web browsers give a means to control web pages. Node.js
      provides server-side features, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s a bird’s-eye view of what we have when JavaScript runs in a web
      browser:
    </p>
    <p><img src="windowObjects.svg" /></p>
    <p>There’s a “root” object called <code>window</code>. It has two roles:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        First, it is a global object for JavaScript code, as described in the
        chapter <a href="info:global-object" class="uri">info:global-object</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, it represents the “browser window” and provides methods to
        control it.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For instance, here we use it as a global object:</p>
    <p>```js run function sayHi() { alert(“Hello”); }</p>
    <p>
      // global functions are methods of the global object: window.sayHi(); ```
    </p>
    <p>And here we use it as a browser window, to see the window height:</p>
    <p><code>js run alert(window.innerHeight); // inner window height</code></p>
    <p>
      There are more window-specific methods and properties, we’ll cover them
      later.
    </p>
    <h2 id="dom-document-object-model">DOM (Document Object Model)</h2>
    <p>
      Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents all page content as
      objects that can be modified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>document</code> object is the main “entry point” to the page. We
      can change or create anything on the page using it.
    </p>
    <p>For instance:</p>
    <p>
      ```js run // change the background color to red
      document.body.style.background = “red”;
    </p>
    <p>
      // change it back after 1 second setTimeout(() =&gt;
      (document.body.style.background = ""), 1000); ```
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we used <code>document.body.style</code>, but there’s much, much
      more. Properties and methods are described in the specification:
      <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org">DOM Living Standard</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ```smart header=“DOM is not only for browsers” The DOM specification
      explains the structure of a document and provides objects to manipulate
      it. There are non-browser instruments that use DOM too.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, server-side scripts that download HTML pages and process
      them can also use DOM. They may support only a part of the specification
      though. ```
    </p>
    <p>
      ```smart header=“CSSOM for styling” There’s also a separate specification,
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/">CSS Object Model (CSSOM)</a> for
      CSS rules and stylesheets, that explains how they are represented as
      objects, and how to read and write them.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSSOM is used together with DOM when we modify style rules for the
      document. In practice though, CSSOM is rarely required, because we rarely
      need to modify CSS rules from JavaScript (usually we just add/remove CSS
      classes, not modify their CSS rules), but that’s also possible. ```
    </p>
    <h2 id="bom-browser-object-model">BOM (Browser Object Model)</h2>
    <p>
      The Browser Object Model (BOM) represents additional objects provided by
      the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the
      document.
    </p>
    <p>For instance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="mdn:api/Window/navigator">navigator</a> object provides
        background information about the browser and the operating system. There
        are many properties, but the two most widely known are:
        <code>navigator.userAgent</code> – about the current browser, and
        <code>navigator.platform</code> – about the platform (can help to differ
        between Windows/Linux/Mac etc).
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="mdn:api/Window/location">location</a> object allows us to
        read the current URL and can redirect the browser to a new one.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here’s how we can use the <code>location</code> object:</p>
    <p>
      <code
        >js run alert(location.href); // shows current URL if (confirm("Go to
        Wikipedia?")) { location.href = "https://wikipedia.org"; // redirect the
        browser to another URL }</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions <code>alert/confirm/prompt</code> are also a part of BOM: they
      are directly not related to the document, but represent pure browser
      methods of communicating with the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      ```smart header=“Specifications” BOM is the part of the general
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org">HTML specification</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, you heard that right. The HTML spec at
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org" class="uri"
        >https://html.spec.whatwg.org</a
      >
      is not only about the “HTML language” (tags, attributes), but also covers
      a bunch of objects, methods and browser-specific DOM extensions. That’s
      “HTML in broad terms”. Also, some parts have additional specs listed at
      <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org" class="uri">https://spec.whatwg.org</a>.
      ```
    </p>
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>Talking about standards, we have:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>DOM specification</dt>
      <dd>
        Describes the document structure, manipulations and events, see
        <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org" class="uri"
          >https://dom.spec.whatwg.org</a
        >.
      </dd>
      <dt>CSSOM specification</dt>
      <dd>
        Describes stylesheets and style rules, manipulations with them and their
        binding to documents, see
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/" class="uri"
          >https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/</a
        >.
      </dd>
      <dt>HTML specification</dt>
      <dd>
        Describes the HTML language (e.g. tags) and also the BOM (browser object
        model) – various browser functions: <code>setTimeout</code>,
        <code>alert</code>, <code>location</code> and so on, see
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org" class="uri"
          >https://html.spec.whatwg.org</a
        >. It takes the DOM specification and extends it with many additional
        properties and methods.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Additionally, some classes are described separately at
      <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/" class="uri">https://spec.whatwg.org/</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note these links, as there’s so much stuff to learn it’s impossible
      to cover and remember everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you’d like to read about a property or a method, the Mozilla manual
      at
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search" class="uri"
        >https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search</a
      >
      is also a nice resource, but the corresponding spec may be better: it’s
      more complex and longer to read, but will make your fundamental knowledge
      sound and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find something, it’s often convenient to use an internet search “WHATWG
      [term]” or “MDN [term]”, e.g
      <a href="https://google.com?q=whatwg+localstorage" class="uri"
        >https://google.com?q=whatwg+localstorage</a
      >,
      <a href="https://google.com?q=mdn+localstorage" class="uri"
        >https://google.com?q=mdn+localstorage</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we’ll get down to learning DOM, because the document plays the central
      role in the UI.
