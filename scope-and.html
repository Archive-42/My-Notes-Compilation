      Scopes and closures are important in JavaScript. But, they were confusing
      for me when I first started. Here’s an explanation of scopes and closures
      to help you understand what they are.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s start with scopes.</p>
    <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
    <p>
      A scope in JavaScript defines what variables you have access to. There are
      two kinds of scope – global scope and local scope.
    </p>
    <h3 id="global-scope">Global scope</h3>
    <p>
      If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces
      (<code>{}</code>), it is said to be defined in the
      <strong>global scope</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is true only with JavaScript in web browsers. You declare global
      variables in Node.js differently, but we won’t go into Node.js in this
      article.
    </p>
    <pre><code>const globalVariable = &#39;some value&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Once you’ve declared a global variable, you can use that variable anywhere
      in your code, even in functions.
    </p>
    <pre><code>const hello = &#39;Hello CSS-Tricks Reader!&#39;

function sayHello () {
  console.log(hello)
}

console.log(hello)
sayHello()</code></pre>
    <p>
      Although you can declare variables in the global scope, it is advised not
      to. This is because there is a chance of naming collisions, where two or
      more variables are named the same. If you declared your variables with
      <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>, you would receive an error
      whenever a name collision happens. This is undesirable.
    </p>
    <pre><code>let thing = &#39;something&#39;
let thing = &#39;something else&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you declare your variables with <code>var</code>, your second variable
      overwrites the first one after it is declared. This also undesirable as
      you make your code hard to debug.
    </p>
    <pre><code>var thing = &#39;something&#39;
var thing = &#39;something else&#39;
console.log(thing)</code></pre>
    <p>So, you should always declare local variables, not global variables.</p>
    <h3 id="local-scope">Local Scope</h3>
    <p>
      Variables that are usable only in a specific part of your code are
      considered to be in a local scope. These variables are also called
      <strong>local variables</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, there are two kinds of local scope: function scope and
      block scope.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s talk about function scopes first.</p>
    <h3 id="function-scope">Function scope</h3>
    <p>
      When you declare a variable in a function, you can access this variable
      only within the function. You can’t get this variable once you get out of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example below, the variable <code>hello</code> is in the
      <code>sayHello</code> scope:
    </p>
    <pre><code>function sayHello () {
  const hello = &#39;Hello CSS-Tricks Reader!&#39;
  console.log(hello)
}

sayHello()
console.log(hello)</code></pre>
    <h3 id="block-scope">Block scope</h3>
    <p>
      When you declare a variable with <code>const</code> or
      <code>let</code> within a curly brace (<code>{}</code>), you can access
      this variable only within that curly brace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example below, you can see that <code>hello</code> is scoped to the
      curly brace:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{
  const hello = &#39;Hello CSS-Tricks Reader!&#39;
  console.log(hello)
}

console.log(hello)</code></pre>
    <p>
      The block scope is a subset of a function scope since functions need to be
      declared with curly braces (unless you’re using
      <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/es6/#arrow-functions">arrow functions</a>
      with an implicit return).
    </p>
    <h3 id="function-hoisting-and-scopes">Function hoisting and scopes</h3>
    <p>
      Functions, when declared with a function declaration, are always hoisted
      to the top of the current scope. So, these two are equivalent:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sayHello()
function sayHello () {
  console.log(&#39;Hello CSS-Tricks Reader!&#39;)
}


function sayHello () {
  console.log(&#39;Hello CSS-Tricks Reader!&#39;)
}
sayHello()</code></pre>
    <p>
      When declared with a function expression, functions are not hoisted to the
      top of the current scope.
    </p>
    <pre><code>sayHello()
const sayHello = function () {
  console.log(aFunction)
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Because of these two variations, function hoisting can potentially be
      confusing, and should not be used. Always declare your functions before
      you use them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="functions-do-not-have-access-to-each-others-scopes">
      Functions do not have access to each other’s scopes
    </h3>
    <p>
      Functions do not have access to each other’s scopes when you define them
      separately, even though one function may be used in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example below, <code>second</code> does not have access to
      <code>firstFunctionVariable</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function first () {
  const firstFunctionVariable = `I&#39;m part of first`
}

function second () {
  first()
  console.log(firstFunctionVariable)
}</code></pre>
    <h3 id="nested-scopes">Nested scopes</h3>
    <p>
      When a function is defined in another function, the inner function has
      access to the outer function’s variables. This behavior is called
      <strong>lexical scoping</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the outer function does not have access to the inner function’s
      variables.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function outerFunction () {
  const outer = `I&#39;m the outer function!`

  function innerFunction() {
    const inner = `I&#39;m the inner function!`
    console.log(outer)
  }

  console.log(inner)
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      To visualize how scopes work, you can imagine one-way glass. You can see
      the outside, but people from the outside cannot see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/one-way-glass.png?ssl=1"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Scopes in functions behave like a one-way-glass. You can see the outside,
      but people outside can’t see you
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have scopes within scopes, visualize multiple layers of one-way
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/glass-layers.png?ssl=1"
      />
    </p>
    <p>Multiple layers of functions mean multiple layers of one-way glass</p>
    <p>
      After understanding everything about scopes so far, you’re well primed to
      figure out what closures are.
    </p>
    <h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever you create a function within another function, you have created a
      closure. The inner function is the closure. This closure is usually
      returned so you can use the outer function’s variables at a later time.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function outerFunction () {
  const outer = `I see the outer variable!`

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outer)
  }

  return innerFunction
}

outerFunction()()</code></pre>
    <p>
      Since the inner function is returned, you can also shorten the code a
      little by writing a return statement while declaring the function.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function outerFunction () {
  const outer = `I see the outer variable!`

  return function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outer)
  }
}

outerFunction()()</code></pre>
    <p>
      Since closures have access to the variables in the outer function, they
      are usually used for two things:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>To control side effects</li>
      <li>To create private variables</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="controlling-side-effects-with-closures">
      Controlling side effects with closures
    </h3>
    <p>
      Side effects happen when you do something in aside from returning a value
      from a function. Many things can be side effects, like an Ajax request, a
      timeout or even a <code>console.log</code> statement:
    </p>
    <pre><code>function (x) {
  console.log(&#39;A console.log is a side effect!&#39;)
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      When you use closures to control side effects, you’re usually concerned
      with ones that can mess up your code flow like Ajax or timeouts.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s go through this with an example to make things clearer.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s say you want to make a cake for your friend’s birthday. This cake
      would take a second to make, so you wrote a function that logs
      <code>made a cake</code> after one second.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m using
      <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/es6/#arrow-functions"
        >ES6 arrow functions</a
      >
      here to make the example shorter, and easier to understand.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function makeCake() {
  setTimeout(_ =&gt; console.log(`Made a cake`), 1000)
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      As you can see, this cake making function has a side effect: a timeout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s further say you want your friend to choose a flavor for the cake. To
      do so, you can write add a flavor to your <code>makeCake</code> function.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function makeCake(flavor) {
  setTimeout(_ =&gt; console.log(`Made a ${flavor} cake!`), 1000)
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      When you run the function, notice the cake gets made immediately after one
      second.
    </p>
    <pre><code>makeCake(&#39;banana&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      The problem here is that you don’t want to make the cake immediately after
      knowing the flavor. You want to make it later when the time is right.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this problem, you can write a <code>prepareCake</code> function
      that stores your flavor. Then, return the <code>makeCake</code> closure
      within <code>prepareCake</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point on, you can call the returned function whenever you want
      to, and the cake will be made within a second.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function prepareCake (flavor) {
  return function () {
    setTimeout(_ =&gt; console.log(`Made a ${flavor} cake!`), 1000)
  }
}

const makeCakeLater = prepareCake(&#39;banana&#39;)


makeCakeLater()</code></pre>
    <p>
      That’s how closures are used to reduce side effects – you create a
      function that activates the inner closure at your whim.
    </p>
    <h3 id="private-variables-with-closures">
      Private variables with closures
    </h3>
    <p>
      As you know by now, variables created in a function cannot be accessed
      outside the function. Since they can’t be accessed, they are also called
      private variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, sometimes you need to access such a private variable. You can do
      so with the help of closures.
    </p>
    <pre><code>function secret (secretCode) {
  return {
    saySecretCode () {
      console.log(secretCode)
    }
  }
}

const theSecret = secret(&#39;CSS Tricks is amazing&#39;)
theSecret.saySecretCode()</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>saySecretCode</code> in this example above is the only function (a
      closure) that exposes the <code>secretCode</code> outside the original
      secret function. As such, it is also called a
      <strong>privileged function</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="debugging-scopes-with-devtools">Debugging scopes with DevTools</h2>
    <p>
      Chrome and Firefox’s DevTools make it simple for you to debug variables
      you can access in the current scope. There are two ways to use this
      functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first way is to add the <code>debugger</code> keyword in your code.
      This causes JavaScript execution in browsers to pause so you can debug.
    </p>
    <p>Here’s an example with the <code>prepareCake</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>function prepareCake (flavor) {

  debugger
  return function () {
    setTimeout(_ =&gt; console.log(`Made a ${flavor} cake!`), 1000)
  }
}

const makeCakeLater = prepareCake(&#39;banana&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you open your DevTools and navigate to the Sources tab in Chrome (or
      Debugger tab in Firefox), you would see the variables available to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/debugger1.png?ssl=1"
      />
    </p>
    <p>Debugging prepareCake’s scope</p>
    <p>
      You can also shift the <code>debugger</code> keyword into the closure.
      Notice how the scope variables changes this time:
    </p>
    <pre><code>function prepareCake (flavor) {
  return function () {

    debugger
    setTimeout(_ =&gt; console.log(`Made a ${flavor} cake!`), 1000)
  }
}

const makeCakeLater = prepareCake(&#39;banana&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/debugger2.png?ssl=1"
      />
    </p>
    <p>Debugging the closure scope</p>
    <p>
      The second way to use this debugging functionality is to add a breakpoint
      to your code directly in the sources (or debugger) tab by clicking on the
      line number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/breakpoint.png?ssl=1"
      />
    </p>
    <p>Debugging scopes by adding breakpoints</p>
    <h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
    <p>
      Scopes and closures aren’t incredibly hard to understand. They’re pretty
      simple once you know how to see them through a one-way glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you declare a variable in a function, you can only access it in the
      function. These variables are said to be scoped to the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you define any inner function within another function, this inner
      function is called a closure. It retains access to the variables created
      in the outer function.
    </p>
