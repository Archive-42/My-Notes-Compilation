      What’s the temporary complexity of inserting an element in a balanced tree
      in the worst case? Answer: O o(n^2) O o(1) O O(log n) O O(n^n)
    </p>
    <p>Given the following pseudo-code:</p>
    <pre><code>printTree(tree) {
 if (tree.hasLeft) {
  printTree(tree left)

 }

  if (tree.hasRight) {
   printTree(tree.right);

  }

  print(currentNode);
}
What would be the outcome for the following tree?

      Answer: If you had to order a very large array stored in a disk that
      doesn’t fit in memory. What algorithm would you use?
    </p>
    <p>O Bubble sort O Merge sort O Quick sort</p>
    <p>O Heap sort</p>
    <p>
      What method would you use to search a number in an organized array of
      numbers

      ❓ Binary Search ? Assuming that the executing time of an algorithm has a
      quadratic growth rate. For an input size of 1000 it has an execution time
      of 20 ms. Which would be your estimate time of execution for an input of
      size 10000
