## Output even numbers in the loop

<span class="task__importance" title="How important is the task, from 1 to 5">importance: 5</span>

Use the `for` loop to output even numbers from `2` to `10`.

solution

<a href="for-even.html#"
<a href="for-even.html#" class="toolbar__button toolbar__button_edit" title="open in sandbox"></a>

    for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i++) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) {
        alert( i );
      }
    }

We use the “modulo” operator `%` to get the remainder and check for the evenness here.
