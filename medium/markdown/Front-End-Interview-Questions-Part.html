      Favorite is (parametric) mixins; but I don’t have a lot of trouble with

    </p>
    <p>
      forEach iterates over an array item by item, and map calls a function on
      each array item, but returns another/additional array, unlike forEach.

    <p>
      · <strong>What is the difference between a function and a method?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every function is an object. If a value is a function, it is a method.
      Methods have to be ‘received’ by something; functions do not.
    </p>
    <p>· <strong>What is closure?</strong></p>
    <p>
      It is code identified elsewhere that we can use later; gives the ability
      to put functions together. If a variable isn’t defined, a function looks
      outward for context.

    <p>· <strong>Describe the four rules of the ‘this’ keyword.</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          Window/global binding — this is the window/console object. ‘use
          strict’; to prevent window binding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Implicit binding — when a function is called by a dot, the object
          preceding the dot is the ‘this’. 80 percent of ‘this’ is from this
          type of binding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          New binding — points to new object created &amp; returned by
          constructor function
        </p>
      </li>

        <span id="6172"><strong>What is an event?</strong></span>
      </li>

    <p>
      An event is something happening on or to the page, like a mouse click,
      doubleclick, key up/down, pointer out of element/over element, things like
      this. There are tons of “events” that javascript can detect.

        >What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your
        answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research
        on the web.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      ReactJS is a library used to build large applications. It’s very good at
      assisting developers in manipulating the DOM element to create rich user
      experiences. We need a way to off-load the state/data that our apps use,
      and React helps us do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      · <strong>What does it mean to <em>think</em> in react?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes you think about how to organize/build apps a little differently
      because it’s very scalable and allows you to build huge apps. React’s
      one-way data flow makes everything modular and fast. You can build apps
      top-down or bottom-up.
    </p>
    <p>· <strong>Describe state.</strong></p>
    <p>Some data we want to display.</p>
    <p>· <strong>Describe props.</strong></p>
    <p>Props are like function arguments in JS and attributes in HTML.</p>
    <p>
      ·
      <strong
        >What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component
        to state or prop changes?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Side effects are anything that affects something outside the executed
      function’s scope like fetching data from an API, a timer, or logging.
    </p>
    <p>· <strong>Explain benefit(s) using client-side routing?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Answer: It’s much more efficient than the traditional way, because a lot
      of data isn’t being transmitted unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ·
      <strong
        >Why would you use class component over function components (removing
        hooks from the question)?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Because some companies still use class components and don’t want to switch
      their millions of dollars’ worth of code over to all functional hooks, and
      also there’s currently a lot more troubleshooting content out there for
      classes that isn’t out there for hooks. Also, functional components are
      better when you don’t need state, presentational components.
    </p>
    <p>· <strong>Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.</strong></p>
    <p>
      componentDidMount = do the stuff inside this ‘function’ after the
      component mounted
    </p>
    <p>
      componentDidUpdate = do the stuff inside this function after the component
      updated
    </p>
    <p>componentWillUnmount = clean-up in death/unmounting phase</p>
    <p>· <strong>What is the purpose of a custom hook?</strong></p>
    <p>
      allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your
      components by reusing the same hook over and over again
    </p>
    <p>· <strong>Why is it important to test our apps?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Gets bugs fixed faster, reduces regression risk, makes you consider/work
      out the edge cases, acts as documentation, acts as safety net when
      refactoring, makes code more trustworthy
    </p>
    <p>· <strong>What problem does the context API help solve?</strong></p>
    <p>You can store data in a context object instead of prop drilling.</p>
    <p>

      <strong
        >In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their
        role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a
        ‘single source of truth’ in a redux application?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that changes within your app is represented by a single JS
      object called the store. The store contains state for our application.
      When changes are made to our application state, we never write to our
      store object but rather clone the state object, modify the clone, and
      replace the original state with the new copy, never mutating the original
      object. Reducers are the only place we can update our state. Actions tell
      our reducers “how” to update the state, and perhaps with what data it
      should be updated, but only a reducer can actually update the state.
    </p>
    <p>

      <strong
        >What is the difference between Application state and Component state?
        When would be a good time to use one over the other?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      App state is global, component state is local. Use component state when
      you have component-specific variables.
    </p>

        >Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change
        our action-creators?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Redux Thunk is middleware that provides the ability to handle asynchronous
      operations inside our Action Creators, because reducers are normally
      synchronous.

    <p>· <strong>Explain what a token is used for.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Many services out in the wild require the client (our React app, for
      example) to provide proof that it’s authenticated with them. The server
      running these services can issue a JWT (JSON Web Token) as the
      authentication token, in exchange for correct login credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      ·
      <strong
        >What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data
        secure?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      As we build our web apps, we will most likely have some “protected”
      routes — routes that we only want to render if the user has logged in and
      been authenticated by our server. The way this normally works is we make a
      login request, sending the server the user’s username and password. The
      server will check those credentials against what is in the database, and
      if it can authenticate the user, it will return a token. Once we have this
      token, we can add two layers of protection to our app. One with protected
      routes, the other by sending an authentication header with our API calls
      (as we learned in the above objective).
    </p>
    <p>· <strong>Describe how web servers work.</strong></p>
    <p>
      The “world wide web” (which we’ll refer to as “the web”) is just a part of
      the internet — which is itself a network of interconnected computers. The
      web is just one way to share data over the internet. It consists of a body
      of information stored on web servers, ready to be shared across the world.
      The term “web server” can mean two things:
    </p>
    <p>· a computer that stores the code for a website</p>
    <p>· a program that runs on such a computer</p>
    <p>
      The physical computer device that we call a web server is connected to the
      internet, and stores the code for different websites to be shared across
      the world at all times. When we load the code for our websites, or web
      apps, on a server like this, we would say that the server is “hosting” our
      website/app.

    <p>o accumulative hashing rounds.</p>
    <p>· <strong>What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Having an algorithm that hashes the information multiple times (rounds)
      means an attacker needs to have the hash, know the algorithm used, and how
      many rounds were used to generate the hash in the first place. So it
      basically makes it a lot more difficult to get somebody’s password.
