<h3 id="behavioral-cultural-interview-questions">👋🏻 Behavioral &amp; Cultural Interview Questions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Software engineer interviewers ask behavioral/cultural questions to evaluate interviewee’s soft skills, and also to decide whether the candidate is a cultural fit. Make sure you’ve prepared great answers to these interview questions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>Tell me about yourself</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫====&gt; </em></strong>“Tell me about yourself” is one of the most common and important interview questions. However, it can be daunting, as it’s one you need to get right. After all, not only is it your first impression on the interviewer, but you also need to be simultaneously professional and authentic when answering it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>So how can you give a good answer without oversharing? To help you structure your answer, we’ll give you a rough guideline: start with a short introduction, talk about the present, recount the past, and mention your future goals.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3 id="interview-etiquette-other-tips">📝 Interview Etiquette &amp; Other Tips</h3>
<p>Nailing an interview takes more than just knowing how to answer common interview questions. You’ll also need to prepare questions of your own, think about salary, and get your communications right. Here’s how.</p>
<h4 id="questions-to-ask-in-an-interview">Questions to ask in an interview</h4>
<p>⮕As the job seeker, it’s normal to feel like you’re being interrogated during interviews. However, at its core, an interview is a conversation, and should be a two-way interaction. As the interviewee, you need to stay engaged and ask thoughtful questions.</p>
<p>⮕By asking questions, you’re expressing your genuine curiosity towards the company. This helps companies know that you’re serious about them. Additionally, it also helps you evaluate whether the job and/or the company is really what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>⮕There are fantastic resources out there with more than a dozen questions you can ask interviewers. Here, we’ll provide a few that we think are essential to help you gain deeper understandings about the role, company, and your future within the company:</p>
<p>⮕The job and cross-team communication</p>
<p>⮕The company’s values and working culture</p>
<p>⮕What are some shared qualities and characteristics among your employees?</p>
<p>⮕What’s your favorite part about working at the company?</p>
<p>⮕What’s your least favorite part about working at the company?</p>
<p>Professional growth opportunities</p>
<p>⮕Are there multiple product/service teams in the company? Can engineers apply to join a different team? What does the process look like?</p>
<p>⮕Are there professional development courses and training available?</p>
<p>⮕Do senior engineers and engineering leads usually get promoted from within the company?</p>
<h3 id="closing-questions-and-next-steps">Closing questions and next steps</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>Is there anything unclear or concerning about my background that I can help clarify?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>What are the next steps in the interview process?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>Is there anything else I can provide you with that would be helpful?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>How to answer salary expectations?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>“What are you salary expectations?” can be a daunting question. If talking about money wasn’t uncomfortable enough already, most job seekers worry that proposing the “wrong number” would cost them the job — or land them a job offer with a disappointing salary. Not great.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="follow-up">Follow up ?????</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>Depending on how many rounds of interviews you’ve gone through, you may feel differently about how close you are to getting the job. The closer you get to the end of the hiring process, the more likely it is for you to start feeling anxious due to higher expectations. As a result, you may be eager to follow up with the hiring manager regarding your interview results. With that said, there’s a fine line between showing your eager attitude and coming off as desperate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>Before we get to the types of follow up emails you should send out, make sure to ask the hiring manager about when you can expect to hear back from them about next steps. This information will help you decide when it’s appropriate to follow up down the line.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>There are four types of follow up emails you should send at different times after the interview: Thank you email, checking-in email, second follow up email, final follow up email.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="thank-you-email">Thank you email</h4>
<p><strong>A thank you email should be sent out on the same day of the interview or one day after your interview. The main purpose of this email is to show your excitement and appreciation. This email should be short and sweet and should include:</strong></p>
<h4 id="a-thank-you-note-for-their-time">A thank you note for their time</h4>
<p>⮕<strong>A brief mention of the specific job you interviewed for</strong></p>
<p>⮕<strong>A brief note of what you found most impressive about the company</strong></p>
<p>⮕<strong>One or two things you learned about the organization</strong></p>
<p>⮕<strong>One sentence about how you’re excited you are to contribute in a specific way</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫If you can, it’s best to choose to describe an Agile project you worked on, as organizations whether they use a Waterfall or Agile methodology, are keen to work with developers experienced in Agile.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>⚫ Ideally, share a project in which you worked with a bigger team.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫For the least favorite parts, don’t just list the downsides and failures, but also mention what you’ve learned from it and how you would improve.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫ Ensure that you come across humbled from the failures, not exasperated and that you know better than everyone else — even if you truly feel this way!

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫ Questions like this are designed to allow you to showcase your way of thinking. The interviewer is looking to hear your ability to make choices based on rational decisions — so make sure that you show that you can do this!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>To begin with, give an example of a project in which you had the most ownership or you had the greatest sense of achievement/efficiency/effectiveness from the toolchain used.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫ Next, describe the goal of the project, and briefly go through your responsibilities when it came to the toolchain decision-making process. Within Agile work practices, it’s usually a team effort to decide the best programming languages/tools/services are the best fit for the project, within customer requirements. Outline the consultation process you went through with both the customer and your team to arrive at the best solutions.</em></strong></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫Share the toolchain you used when you encountered the problem, then other technologies and tools you applied to help solve it, if applicable. Ensure to note whether there was a full tool pivot or you managed to build onto an existing library (or something similar) to achieve the end goal.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫Remember: the most important thing is not what you ultimately used, but how many options you referred to during the process, and which metrics you adopted to decide which tech to go for. Remember to share the pros and cons of your decision, and if, looking back now, whether you would do it differently.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-would-you-design-this-system-for-scale">5. How would you design this system for scale?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫First of all, the interviewer would like to know the traffic level we’re expecting: 1, 000, 100, 000, or 10 million users per second? Think about the data expectations for each system user, database connections (blocking/nonblocking actions), downtime specifics, and cloud considerations (if any).</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫List the potential problems that might occur when trying to scale. Different traffic levels may have different problems, so make sure you think this through, and decide the priorities of the problems that you should solve. Many codebases are not built for scale, so note code changes that might need to occur, rather than just infrastructure expectations.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫Different traffic levels may have different system architectures. List the options you think best fit your scenario and explain why you choose them. Many apps utilize a stripped-back product (which can be achieved through system architecture) when high traffic levels affect systems, rather than crashing the product completely or users experiencing unacceptable wait times.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫First, do your groundwork to ensure that you thoroughly understand the different testing types. Do you know your unit testing from your regression testing from your user acceptance testing? If you need to brush up, check out this great resource.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫Once you’ve got that on lock, it’s time to share a project that you’ve tested thoroughly before.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫Remember to separate the project into different sections. Each section should apply the testing type that fits its characteristics. Describe the goals of different testing types, and also introduce the library/service you used for the test. (For bonus points: explain the pros and cons of the library/service and whether it was your decision to choose that particular suite.)</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫It makes sense at this point to include documentation (and particularly inline documentation) you use that helps clarify functions/issues so that testing goes smoothly.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫You may also mention a project you were involved in where testing was not well conducted and how you would — or did — go about fixing the issues.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>Pointing fingers at others for the problem</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em></strong>Talking ill of your bosses or coworkers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>⚫</em>Keep in mind that your interviewer is not only trying to get a glimpse of your past, but to gain an understanding of how you might react to challenges should they hire you. Therefore, when you’re choosing your scenario, try to pick one that may be applicable in your new work setting as well.</strong></p>
