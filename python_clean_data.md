    ValueError: labels['columnName'] not contained in axis

-   \[✅\] The axis must be set equal to 1 to drop a column from a dataframe.
-   \[\] The axis must be set to only if there are new rows in the dataframe.
-   \[\] The syntax must be changed to dataf.drop(‘columnName’,axis == 0)
-   \[\] The axis parameter must come before the column name parameter.

-   \[\] The values in the newly added row will be zero.
-   \[✅\] A Null value or NaN will be added for the values of the newly indexed row.
-   \[\] The new row values will mirror the values of the row before it.

#### 7. Which collection data type does re.findall() return?

-   \[✅\] List
-   \[\] String
-   \[\] Integer
-   \[\] Set

#### 8. Which command will drop all rows in dataset ‘df’ containing missing values?

-   \[\] df.dropna(all)
-   \[\] dropna()

#### 10. You have been assigned the task of importing large amounts of CSV data (comma separated values) into your current application. All of the data

contains first and last names. How can you make sure the data will not conflict with the data currently residing in your application’s dataframes

-   \[\] Query the dataframe field type to ensure they are floats.
-   \[\] Query the dataframe indexes to ensure they are objects.
-   \[\] Query the dataframe field type to ensure they are integers
-   \[✅\] Query the dataframe field type to ensure they are objects.

#### 11. You have a DataFrame df with the shape (4,3) with the following data:

    Sales| Realised Profit |Expected Profit
    ||
    451210 |84012 |165813
    549845 |64205 |104877
    231384 |52209 |175926
    781206 |59121 |124561

Based on this data, what is the output of the following code

    try:
      df.drop("Expected Profit", axis=1, inplace=True)
      print (df.shape)
    except:
      print(df.shape)

-   \[\] (5, 3)
-   \[\] (5, 3)
-   \[✅\] (4,2)
-   \[\] (6, 3)

#### 12. What does the following line of code do?

myDataFrame.columns = map(str.upper, myDataFrame.columns)

-   \[\] Adds a column named “str.upper” to myDataFrame
-   \[✅\] Capitalizes all columns within myDataFrame
-   \[\] Maps all column field names to a new column named “upper”
-   \[\] Checks all columns within myDataFrame for capitalization

#### 13. What is raised in case the assert condition evaluates to ‘false’?

-   \[✅\] AssertionError
-   \[\] Error
-   \[\] Assertion\_Error
-   \[\] AssertionBug

#### 14. Given the following example, what is the expected output?

    data = pd.Series(['60','0.0','100.0'])
    print(data.str.contains('.0', regex=False) )

-   \[\] True True False
-   \[✅\] False True True
-   \[\] True True True
-   \[\] False True False

#### 15. We have sales data within a dataframe that contain product labels, prices, and quantities. How could we better arrange this data so we can see what

products are selling the least

-   \[✅\] Use set\_index() to set the quantities as the index to sort from least to greatest.
-   \[\] Use aggregate() to find the mean of the quantities.
-   \[\] Use set\_index() to set the prices as the index to sort from least to greatest.
-   \[\] Use aggregate() to find the median of the quantities.

#### 16. An existing dataframe has unsorted yearly sales data. You would like to arrange the data so you can slice it out later by the year. What is the -best way to transform this dataframe to accomplish this goal

-   \[\] Sort the index in place to return the dataframe to its original state.
-   \[✅\] Create a sequential index by setting the year as the index, grouping the dataframe by yearly sales.
-   \[\] Assign a new column to the original dataframe with the sorted yearly data.
-   \[\] Drop the years from the dataframe and assign a new column with sorted yearly data.
