### Second Project Question

Matt is your counterpart at Gourmet Ventures, company BairesDev has a long-lasting relationship with. But Matt has only been working for Gourmet Ventures for only 4 months. Currently 5 engineers are working on full time basis for this client, in a Staff Augmentation arrangement. Workload has been high over the last months, as they are urged to launch a new App. Matt has proved to be slightly difficult to work with, he challenged hours in extra time reported by the time tracking reports, and he questioned the productivity of particularly one of the developers (Martin), that you (without saying it to Matt) agree with the evaluation. -You know Matt appreciates the efforts and technical capabilities of two other team members:Juan Carlos and Edson Juan Carlos is Argentinean, and Edson is Brazilian). The two other remaining engineers (Stephanie and Alberto), are doing a good job and you never received any specific feedback on their performance. You were requested by BairesDev Management to try to obtain a rate increasefor both Juan Carlos and Edson, based on an evaluation you submitted on their performance. Therefore,you gave Matt a call in order to discuss this matter.

Evidently you caught Matt by surprise, as he was notexpecting the request.Probably to gain some time, he said he was extremely busy with some internal reporting and requestedyou to write an email to him describing the rationale for the rate increase, as he didn’t necessarilyappreciate why the rates should be increased, and he wanted your explanation to be used as a guidelinefor an upcoming conversation in a few days.Making assumptions on considerations on aspects not specifically mentioned on this description, pleasewrite the email (in English) you will be writing to Matt justifying why rates should be increased forJuan Carlos and Edson. Consider making any other recommendation you would like regarding the rest of theteam, as you deem appropriate.You may also include an explanation beyond the email (not to be sent to Matt), explaining why youwrote in the body of the email, and what assumptions you made during the reply as part of this same exercise. Please differentiate clearly this explanation from the body of the email to Matt
