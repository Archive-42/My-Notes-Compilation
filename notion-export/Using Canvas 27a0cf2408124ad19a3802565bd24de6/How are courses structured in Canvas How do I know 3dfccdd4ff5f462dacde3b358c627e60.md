This section will walk through general Canvas tools, and the structure of your technical courses.

## Home Page

The home page is where you land when you access a course from your dashboard or courses tab. The home page contains links to view your progress (grades) and provides several different options to access your content (Modules, To Do List, and Course Calendar) which we'll explore in the sections below

## Modules

Modules is where you access everything you need to read, every project you need to complete, every form you need to fill out, etc. In your technical sprints (Web, DS, and CS), each module contains three sections: Warmup, Engage, and Prepare.

### Warmup

This is your preclass content (formerly Training Kit). _Before_ guided project each day, you should read through this content and watch the videos, so that you can properly follow along with your instructor as they code.

### Engage

This section contains your module project, and relevant progress checks to engage with the module's content. Every day for full time students, and every project day for part time students, you should plan to submit the items in this section.

### Review

This section contains links to previously recorded guided projects to give you alternative perspectives on the content, if needed.

## Grades

The final tab on the course sidebar is `Grades`, here you can check your status on all of the projects and forms for a given course, and view your learning mastery for each module.

## Other Features

One of Canvas' features (though, some might call it a flaw) is that it offers many routes to the same content. In addition to the tools above, you may find the following options useful.

### Course Calendar

You can access your calendar from the left-hand global navigation bar, or a course-specific calendar from the home page of that course. The calendar will show all quizzes and assignment due dates, in a calendar view. You can click on an assignment to see more details of that assignment.

### To-Do List

You can access your To Do list from your Dashboard, or view a course-specific To Do list on the right hand side of that course. This shows the same information as calendar view, but removes the assignments and quizzes that you have already submitted.

# Lambda Leadership

<span class="icon">ðŸ”‘</span>

In addition to your technical course, you will be enrolled in a leadership course for peer mentorship and track teams content. **Review the content above to get an overview of general Canvas features.**

The general navigation principles are the same here - modules is the best place to view content in chronological order, the to do list and calendar features are still functional and can help you figure out what you need to be doing and when.

So what's different? Since this course has a lot less content, the enrollment spans a whole unit, where each module contains all daily activities for an entire sprint. (In your technical course each module is just... a module).

You will walk through the "Investigate", "Apply", and "Sync" agendas during your track team meetings, one per meeting. The Team and Leadership reflections are meant to help you reflect on these meetings, in addition to your peer mentorship session.

![](How%20are%20courses%20structured%20in%20Canvas%20How%20do%20I%20know%203dfccdd4ff5f462dacde3b358c627e60/Untitled%201.png)

Just like with your technical course, if you ever feel like you haven't completed something, you can use `Grades`, `To-do`, or `Calendar` to check your status.

# Other Courses

Throughout your student journey, you will be enrolled in other courses - like build sprints and endorsement. These follow generally the same structure as the courses above. When in doubt, navigate to modules and work your way through.
