### Everything you need to know about using Canvas at Lambda School. Canvas helps you:

- Organize all of the learning material your instructor has created

<!-- -->

- Keep track of the work you are assigned by your instructor, scores and feedback

<!-- -->

- Submit retrospectives, quizzes, and assessments. It also lets you view the status of your submissions.

<!-- -->

- Help you stay in touch with other members of your class

<span class="icon">üìå</span>

There are several features in Canvas you don‚Äôt need to worry about at the moment. Continue using Slack for announcements and messaging; continue relying on your student Google Calendar for scheduling. We will not be using Canvas for discussions, collaborations, or video conferences.

# üíª Logging In

- **Course Invitation**

  - Lambda Launch and Unit 1 students

    If you are a new student, you should receive a Canvas invitation in the inbox of your Lambda School email. In that email, click the "Get Started" button to jump into Canvas. The invitation will look something like this:

    ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/cef7fb4c-b0af-4d3b-9d8f-73988088ae96.png)

    If haven't received a Canvas invitation in your email, try navigating directly to [Lambda School's Canvas homepage](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/). If you are prompted to login, use the same credentials that you use to sign into your student dashboards.

    If you are still having trouble accessing Canvas, please submit a `/frontdesk` ticket via Slack. To submit a ticket, type /frontdesk into any direct message in Slack and hit "return" or "enter" twice. Fill out the form and someone will respond to you, typically within 24 hours to your @lambdastudents.com email account.

  <!-- -->

  - All Other Students

    Instead of looking in their Lambda School email, existing students should access Canvas directly by navigating to [Lambda School's Canvas homepage](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/). If you are prompted to login, use the same credentials that you use to sign into your student dashboards. Once logged in, you should be able to view all of the sprints for your current unit in Canvas. It's important to note that each course in Canvas is **one sprint** for Lambda, so you will have at least four courses per unit. Your Canvas homepage should look similar to the screenshot below, but with different courses.

    ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/Screen_Shot_2020-10-22_at_10.24.21_AM.png)

    If you are still having trouble accessing Canvas after following the instructions above, please submit a `/frontdesk` ticket via Slack.

- **Finding Current and Past Courses**

  To find your current courses, navigate to [the Canvas homepage](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/). Once there, you should see all of the courses (sprints) that you are enrolled in for this unit. For example, a WEB36 student in Unit 2 would see 4 courses for their current unit, 1 course for the Lambda Leadership program, and 1 Career & Professional Development course.

  ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/Screen_Shot_2020-10-22_at_11.54.11_AM.png)

  You should then be able to see all of your current and past courses in one list.

  ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/Screen_Shot_2020-10-22_at_11.54.24_AM.png)

<!-- -->

- **Home Pages**

  The Course Home Page helps you navigate the course and manage your coursework.

  All Home Page options include:

  - A sidebar with a to-do list that shows announcements and up to seven assignments that you need to submit

    ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/Viewing_the_Course_Home_Page.gif)

<!-- -->

- **Custom Course Navigation**

  The Course Navigation list may look slightly different for each course. "Home" will always be at the top of the course navigation list. In most cases, it will be followed by "Modules" and "Grades". The Modules tab lets you access all of the course content and assignments for the course. The Grades tab will let you see the submission status for your assignments and view your Learning Mastery of the sprint's objectives.

  ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/Course_Navigation_Examples.gif)

<!-- -->

- **Navigating Modules**

  Your instructor may organize your course into Modules. Think of a module as tabs in a binder. Each module will have learning materials and activities in an order that is best for learning.

  Select "Modules" from the Course Navigation on the left.

  ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/Accessing_and_Viewing_Modules.gif)

  To begin a module, click the first item in the module.

  You can advance through module items or return to previous modules using the progression bar at the bottom of the page. To advance to the next module item, click the¬†**Next**¬†button. To return to a previous module item, click the¬†**Previous**¬†button.

  You can view the name of the next or previous module item by hovering over the Next or Previous button, respectively.

  ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/d16cfafc-8db3-44f8-86fd-1c34878f807d.png)

<!-- -->

- **Module Breakdown**

  In Modules, you can view all the modules in your course. Modules are organized by order of progression.

  Modules house the content items within each module. By default, modules are expanded and show all items in the module \[1\]. To collapse the module, click the collapse arrow \[2\].

  ![](Using%20Canvas%2027a0cf2408124ad19a3802565bd24de6/567df5f1-da89-40b4-9f41-f2964e53c49a.png)

  **Note:¬†\***The Modules page supports keyboard shortcuts. To view a list of keyboard shortcuts, press the Comma key.\*

  If a module includes requirements, the header shows whether you are supposed to complete all requirements or select one requirement. Next to the module item, you can view the type of requirement necessary to complete the module item. You must complete all required module items before you can progress to the next module. Some modules may require you to complete the module items in order.
