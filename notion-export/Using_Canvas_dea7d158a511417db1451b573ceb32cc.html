      There are several features in Canvas you don’t need to worry about at the
      moment. Continue using Slack for announcements and messaging; continue
      relying on your student Google Calendar for scheduling. We will not be
      using Canvas for discussions, collaborations, or video conferences.

              If you are a new student, you should receive a Canvas invitation
              in the inbox of your Lambda School email. In that email, click the
              “Get Started” button to jump into Canvas. The invitation will look
              something like this:

                >Lambda School’s Canvas homepage</a

              If you are still having trouble accessing Canvas, please submit a

            <p>
              Instead of looking in their Lambda School email, existing students
              should access Canvas directly by navigating to
              <a href="https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/"
                >Lambda School’s Canvas homepage</a
              >. If you are prompted to login, use the same credentials that you
              use to sign into your student dashboards. Once logged in, you
              should be able to view all of the sprints for your current unit in
              Canvas. It’s important to note that each course in Canvas is
              <strong>one sprint</strong> for Lambda, so you will have at least
              four courses per unit. Your Canvas homepage should look similar to
              the screenshot below, but with different courses.

        <p><strong>Finding Current and Past Courses</strong></p>
        <p>
          To find your current courses, navigate to
          <a href="https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/">the Canvas homepage</a
          >. Once there, you should see all of the courses (sprints) that you
          are enrolled in for this unit. For example, a WEB36 student in Unit 2
          would see 4 courses for their current unit, 1 course for the Lambda
          Leadership program, and 1 Career &amp; Professional Development
          course.
        </p>

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’d like to see course content from a previous unit, click the
          “Courses” button on the left side panel and then click “All Courses”.
        </p>

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          You should then be able to see all of your current and past courses in
          one list.

          The Course Navigation list may look slightly different for each
          course. “Home” will always be at the top of the course navigation
          list. In most cases, it will be followed by “Modules” and “Grades”.
          The Modules tab lets you access all of the course content and
          assignments for the course. The Grades tab will let you see the
          submission status for your assignments and view your Learning Mastery
          of the sprint’s objectives.

        <p><strong>Navigating Modules</strong></p>
        <p>
          Your instructor may organize your course into Modules. Think of a
          module as tabs in a binder. Each module will have learning materials
          and activities in an order that is best for learning.
        </p>
        <p>Select “Modules” from the Course Navigation on the left.</p>
        <p>
          <img

          />
        </p>
        <p>To begin a module, click the first item in the module.</p>
        <p>
          You can advance through module items or return to previous modules
          using the progression bar at the bottom of the page. To advance to the
          next module item, click the <strong>Next</strong> button. To return to
          a previous module item, click the <strong>Previous</strong> button.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can view the name of the next or previous module item by hovering
          over the Next or Previous button, respectively.

        <p><strong>Module Breakdown</strong></p>
        <p>
          In Modules, you can view all the modules in your course. Modules are
          organized by order of progression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modules house the content items within each module. By default,
          modules are expanded and show all items in the module [1]. To collapse
          the module, click the collapse arrow [2].

          <strong>Note: *</strong>The Modules page supports keyboard shortcuts.
          To view a list of keyboard shortcuts, press the Comma key.*
        </p>
        <p>
          If a module includes requirements, the header shows whether you are
          supposed to complete all requirements or select one requirement. Next
          to the module item, you can view the type of requirement necessary to
          complete the module item. You must complete all required module items
          before you can progress to the next module. Some modules may require
          you to complete the module items in order.
