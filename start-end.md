## Regexp ^$

Which string matches the pattern `^$`?

solution

An empty string is the only match: it starts and immediately finishes.

The task once again demonstrates that anchors are not characters, but tests.

The string is empty `""`. The engine first matches the `^` (input start), yes itâ€™s there, and then immediately the end `$`, itâ€™s here too. So thereâ€™s a match.
