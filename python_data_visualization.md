image = cv2.input('picture.jpg')

equ = cv2.equalize( image)
highRes = np.hstack((image, equ) )
cv2.output ( 'highRes.png' ,highRes)
```

- []
data = [t1, t2]

layout = go.Layout(
barmode=' basic’
)
fig = go.Figure(data=-data, layout=layout)
py.plot(dogsFigure, filename='grouped-bar')
```

#### 3. Why does this code fail to create two trace points of data for the 3D scatter plot?

```python
import plotly.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import numpy as np
x, y, z = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.array([0,0,0]), np.eye(3), 200).transpose()
tracel = go.Scatter3d(
x=x,
y=y
z=z,
)
x2, y2, Z2 = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.array([0,0,0]), np.eye(3), 200).transpose()
trace2 = go.Scatter3d(
x=x,
y=y,
z=z,
)
data = [trace1]
fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)
py.iplot(fig3D, filename='3dTEST')
```
