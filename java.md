Q2 Which statement declares an integer field that is shared by all the instances of
the Holder class?

  private int index;
  }

Q3 You have an application developed by two teams. The first team uses Windows development machines and the second one MacOS development machines. They both deliver a module of your application, the source code and the compiled code in JARs. How can you run this application on your Linux server?

- [] Since MacOS is based on Linux, just recompile the source code compiled on Windows machines, then package it and deploy and run it on your Linux server.

- [] Recompile all the source code on a Linux machine, then package it and deploy and run it on your Linux server.

- [] Recompile all the source code on any machine, using cross-compilation, then package it and deploy and run it on your Linux server.

- [✅] Package the JARs, deploy them and run them without having to recompile anything

Q4 What is the difference between an instance of the String class and array of
chars?

- [✅] An instance of String is a reference on an object that wraps an array of chars or bytes, depending on the version of Java

- [] An instance of String is a just wrapper on an array of chars or bytes, depending on the version of Java.

- [] An instance of String is a just reference on a List of chars or bytes, depending on the version of Java.

- [] An instance of String is in fact just a reference on an array of chars or bytes, depending on the version of Java.

Q6 Which is a legal class declaration given that ClassA and ClassB are classes and
InterfaceA and InterfaceB are interfaces?

- [✅] class A extends ClassA, ClassB implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB

- [] class A implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB extends ClassA

- [✅] The add() returns false and the element is not added

Q9 You have the following class:

public class Holder {
public Holder(int capacity) { }
}

..
}
}

What code do you need to add to the SmartHolder constructor?

- [] super();
- [✅] super(capacity);
- [] this(capacity);

- [] this();

Q12 How can you add a method to an existing interface without having to modify
the classes that already implement it?

- [] You make this method an abstract method.

- [] You cannot add a method to an interface without implementing it in the existing implementing classes.

- [] You provide an implementation of this method in a separate static class.

- [✅] You make this method a default method.

Q13 i is an int of value 2 and the result variable is declared. What does the following code print out?

switch(i) {

case 1: result = 1;
break;

case 2: result = 2;

}

system.out.printIn(“result ="+ result);

- [] result = 2
- [] result = 3
- [✅] result = 4
- [] result = 1

Q14 You have a Person class with aname property of type string . You have a

- [] A list of the names of the people

- [] A string with the concatenation of the names of the people if they are not null, separated by commas

- [] A string with the concatenation of the names of the people if they are not empty, separated by commas
