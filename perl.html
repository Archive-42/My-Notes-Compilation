<p>AN ___ is a special character or a secuenceï¿½which will define the amount of times that thecharacter or the previous sequence will show -ï¿½ character class -ï¿½ Meta character -O quantifier -ï¿½ Assert</p>
<p>In Perl, Which is the switch used to print notices.of typographical errors in the code? -P, -w, -p or -W</p>
<p>When you want to find a search pattern, to describe that pattern you should use: -CO A text string in quotes -ï¿½ A select statement in MySQL -O A regular expression</p>
<p>-ï¿½ A template</p>
<p>The printf statement in the format “%6.2f”shows a number… -ï¿½ Atleat six columns wide in total, with two decimlas places after the comma -O Exactly six digits before the decimal and two digits after -CO At least six digits before the decimal and two digist after</p>
<p>-O Exactly six columns wide in total with two decimal places after the comma</p>
<p>?Case is open (FH, “zzz.txt”): -ï¿½ Opens the zzz.txt file for reading</p>
<p>-ï¿½ Opens the zzz.txt file for rewriting</p>
<p>-ï¿½ Contains an error, therefore it won’t compile</p>
<p>-ï¿½ Opens the zzz.txt file to keep adding text</p>
<p>Which of the following examples checks that $qncontains the word “perl”? -O if (Sqn =~ /perl/)…… -O if (Sqn =“perl”)….. -O if (Sqn ==“perl”)… -O if (Sqn eq ‘perl’)…</p>
<p>Which of the following commands will convert a scalar in an array of characters? -O <span class="citation" data-cites="a">@a</span> = split($str)</p>
<p>-O <span class="citation" data-cites="a">@a</span>= split(//, $str)</p>
<p>-O This task can be made in Perl but none of the above commands do</p>
<p>-O <span class="citation" data-cites="a">@a</span>= split(/./, $str)</p>
<p>?Perl calls a subroutine called autoload-ï¿½ When it calls a routine that it doesn’t exist neither in the module where it should nor in any module which inherits</p>
<p>-CO Within the statement used</p>
<p>-ï¿½ When the module Selfloader has been loaded with the use statement and the subroutine that hasnt been loaded is called</p>
<p>-ï¿½ When a call to the eval function, or a command s/../…/ with the option ’e" is executed</p>
<p>?If $x contains the string:<B>This is black</B><EM>and this is emphasized</EM><BR>and this is <FONT COLOR=green> bright</FONT>Which Perl command could remove all the tags to give:This is black and this is empahized and this is bright-O Sx=~s/&lt;._&gt;//g; -O Sx=~tr/&lt;&gt;/ /s; -O Sx=~s/&lt;(._)&gt;//g; -O Sx=~s/&lt;.*?&gt;//sg;</p>
<p>Which of the following means “1 or more blank spaces”in a “regular expression match”?-+ -[+] --+ -</p>
