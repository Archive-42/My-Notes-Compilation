What's the temporary complexity of inserting an element in a balanced tree in the worst case?
 Answer:
O o(n^2)
O o(1)
O O(log n)
O O(n^n)

Given the following pseudo-code:

```
printTree(tree) {
 if (tree.hasLeft) {
  printTree(tree left)

 }

  if (tree.hasRight) {
   printTree(tree.right);

  }

  print(currentNode);
}
What would be the outcome for the following tree?
      10
   5       23
2     7  18   31
    5
```
