      The production build has all the tools necessary to generate a first-class
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/"
        >Progressive Web App</a
      >, but <strong>the offline/cache-first behavior is opt-in only</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting with Create React App 4, you can add a
      <code>src/service-worker.js</code> file to your project to use the
      built-in support for
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/">Workbox</a>’s
      <code
        >[InjectManifest](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-webpack-plugin.InjectManifest)</code
      >
      plugin, which will
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/using-bundlers"
        >compile</a
      >
      your service worker and inject into it a list of URLs to
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/precache-files"
        >precache</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you start a new project using one of the PWA
      <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/"
        >custom templates</a
      >, you’ll get a <code>src/service-worker.js</code> file that serves as a
      good starting point for an offline-first service worker:
    </p>
    <pre><code>npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa</code></pre>
    <p>The TypeScript equivalent is:</p>
    <pre><code>npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa-typescript</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you know that you won’t be using service workers, or if you’d prefer to
      use a different approach to creating your service worker, don’t create a
      <code>src/service-worker.js</code> file. The
      <code>InjectManifest</code> plugin won’t be run in that case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to creating your local
      <code>src/service-worker.js</code> file, it needs to be registered before
      it will be used. In order to opt-in to the offline-first behavior,
      developers should look for the following in their
      <code
        >[src/index.js](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/src/index.js)</code
      >
      file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.// Learn more about service workers: https://cra.link/PWAserviceWorkerRegistration.unregister();</code></pre>
    <p>
      As the comment states, switching
      <code>serviceWorker.unregister()</code> to
      <code>serviceWorker.register()</code> will opt you in to using the service
      worker.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-opt-in">Why Opt-in?</h2>
    <p>
      Offline-first Progressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than
      traditional web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All static site assets that are a part of your
        <code>webpack</code> build are cached so that your page loads fast on
        subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity (such as 2G or
        3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This
        means your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the
        subway.
      </li>
      <li>
        On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user’s home
        screen, app icon and all. This eliminates the need for the app store.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, they
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2398"
        >can make debugging deployments more challenging</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <code
        >[workbox-webpack-plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin)</code
      >
      is integrated into production configuration, and it will take care of
      compiling a service worker file that will automatically precache all of
      your <code>webpack</code>-generated assets and keep them up to date as you
      deploy updates. The service worker will use a
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network"
        >cache-first strategy</a
      >
      for handling all requests for <code>webpack</code>-generated assets,
      including
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/high-performance-loading#first_what_are_navigation_requests"
        >navigation requests</a
      >
      for your HTML, ensuring that your web app is consistently fast, even on a
      slow or unreliable network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Resources that are not generated by <code>webpack</code>, such as
      static files that are copied over from your local
      <code>[public/</code>
      directory](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/tree/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/)
      or third-party resources, will not be precached. You can optionally set up
      Workbox
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/route-requests"
        >routes</a
      >
      to apply the runtime caching strategy of your choice to those resources.
    </p>
    <h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
    <p>
      Starting with Create React App 4, you have full control over customizing
      the logic in this service worker, by creating your own
      <code>src/service-worker.js</code> file, or customizing the one added by
      the <code>cra-template-pwa</code> (or
      <code>cra-template-pwa-typescript</code>) template. You can use
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules"
        >additional modules</a
      >
      from the Workbox project, add in a push notification library, or remove
      some of the default caching logic. The one requirement is that you keep
      <code>self.__WB_MANIFEST</code> somewhere in your file, as the Workbox
      compilation plugin checks for this value when generating a manifest of
      URLs to precache. If you would prefer not to use precaching, you can
      assign <code>self.__WB_MANIFEST</code> to a variable that will be ignored,
      like:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-globalsconst ignored = self.__WB_MANIFEST;// Your custom service worker code goes here.</code></pre>
    <h2 id="offline-first-considerations">Offline-First Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      If you do decide to opt-in to service worker registration, please take the
      following into account:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        After the initial caching is done, the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle"
          >service worker lifecycle</a
        >
        controls when updated content ends up being shown to users. In order to
        guard against
        <a
          href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3613#issuecomment-353467430"
          >race conditions with lazy-loaded content</a
        >, the default behavior is to conservatively keep the updated service
        worker in the “<a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle#waiting"
          >waiting</a
        >” state. This means that users will end up seeing older content until
        they close (reloading is not enough) their existing, open tabs. See
        <a href="https://jeffy.info/2018/10/10/sw-in-c-r-a.html"
          >this blog post</a
        >
        for more details about this behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users aren’t always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be
        useful to
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption"
          >let the user know</a
        >
        when the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a
        “This web app works offline!” message) and also let them know when the
        service worker has fetched the latest updates that will be available the
        next time they load the page (showing a “New content is available once
        existing tabs are closed.” message). Showing these messages is currently
        left as an exercise to the developer, but as a starting point, you can
        make use of the logic included in
        <code
          >[src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js)</code
        >, which demonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen
        for to detect each scenario, and which as a default, only logs
        appropriate messages to the JavaScript console.
      </li>
      <li>
        Service workers
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https"
          >require HTTPS</a
        >, although to facilitate local testing, that policy
        <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385"
          >does not apply to <code>localhost</code></a
        >. If your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the
        service worker registration will fail, but the rest of your web app will
        remain functional.
      </li>
      <li>
        The service worker is only enabled in the
        <a href="deployment.md">production environment</a>, e.g. the output of
        <code>npm run build</code>. It’s recommended that you do not enable an
        offline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can
        lead to frustration when previously cached assets are used and do not
        include the latest changes you’ve made locally.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you <em>need</em> to test your offline-first service worker locally,
        build the application (using <code>npm run build</code>) and run a
        standard http server from your build directory. After running the build
        script, <code>create-react-app</code> will give instructions for one way
        to test your production build locally and the
        <a href="deployment.md">deployment instructions</a> have instructions
        for using other methods.
        <em
          >Be sure to always use an incognito window to avoid complications with
          your browser cache.</em
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or
        cache any cross-origin traffic, like HTTP
        <a href="integrating-with-an-api-backend.md">API requests</a>, images,
        or embeds loaded from a different domain. Starting with Create React App
        4, this can be customized, as explained above.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="progressive-web-app-metadata">Progressive Web App Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      The default configuration includes a web app manifest located at
      <code
        >[public/manifest.json](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/manifest.json)</code
      >, that you can customize with details specific to your web application.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on
      Android, the metadata in
      <code
        >[manifest.json](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/manifest.json)</code
      >
      determines what icons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app
      is displayed.
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/"
        >The Web App Manifest guide</a
      >
      provides more context about what each field means, and how your
      customizations will affect your users’ experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progressive web apps that have been added to the homescreen will load
      faster and work offline when there’s an active service worker. That being
      said, the metadata from the web app manifest will still be used regardless
      of whether or not you opt-in to service worker registration.
