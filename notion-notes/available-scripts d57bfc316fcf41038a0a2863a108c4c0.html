    <p>In the project directory, you can run:</p>
    <h2 id="npm-start"><code>npm start</code></h2>
    <p>
      Runs the app in the development mode. Open
      <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in
      the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors
      in the console.
    </p>
    <h2 id="npm-test"><code>npm test</code></h2>
    <p>
      Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section
      about <a href="running-tests.md">running tests</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <h2 id="npm-run-build"><code>npm run build</code></h2>
    <p>
      Builds the app for production to the <code>build</code> folder. It
      correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
      best performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. If necessary,
      classnames and function names can be enabled for profiling purposes. See
      the <a href="production-build.md">production build</a> section for more
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about
      <a href="deployment.md">deployment</a> for more information about
      deploying your application to popular hosting providers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="npm-run-eject"><code>npm run eject</code></h2>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you <code>eject</code>, you
        can’t go back!</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you
      can <code>eject</code> at any time. This command will remove the single
      build dependency from your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
      dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project as
      dependencies in <code>package.json</code>. Technically, the distinction
      between dependencies and development dependencies is pretty arbitrary for
      front-end apps that produce static bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, it used to cause problems with some hosting platforms that
      didn’t install development dependencies (and thus weren’t able to build
      the project on the server or test it right before deployment). You are
      free to rearrange your dependencies in <code>package.json</code> as you
      see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they
      will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
      you’re on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t have to ever use <code>eject</code>. The curated feature set is
      suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel
      obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool
      wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
