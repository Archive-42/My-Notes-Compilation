# PUBLIC_URL

Development: ✅ Used Production: ✅ Used Usage: Create React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web server’s root or a subpath as specified in deployment\#building-for-relative-pathsdeployment\#building-for-relative-pathsdeployment\#building-for-relative-pathsdeployment\#building-for-relative-paths. Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname. You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included). This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.
