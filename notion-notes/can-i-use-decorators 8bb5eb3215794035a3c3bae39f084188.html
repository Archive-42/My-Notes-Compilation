    <p>
      Some popular libraries use
      <a
        href="https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841"
        >decorators</a
      >
      in their documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create React App intentionally doesn’t support decorator syntax at the
      moment because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is an experimental proposal and is subject to change (in fact, it has
        already changed once, and will change again).
      </li>
      <li>
        Most libraries currently support only the old version of the proposal —
        which will never be a standard.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without
      decorators and achieve the same result.
    </p>
    <p>Please refer to these two threads for reference:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/214"
          >#214</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/411"
          >#411</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Create React App will add decorator support when the specification
      advances to a stable stage.
