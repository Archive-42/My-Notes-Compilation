    <p>
      With webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to
      CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can
      <strong><code>import</code> a file right in a JavaScript module</strong>.
      This tells webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports,
      importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path
      you can reference in your code, e.g. as the <code>src</code> attribute of
      an image or the <code>href</code> of a link to a PDF.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are
      less than 10,000 bytes returns a
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs"
        >data URI</a
      >
      instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp,
      gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1153"
        >#1153</a
      >. You can control the 10,000 byte threshold by setting the
      <code>IMAGE_INLINE_SIZE_LIMIT</code> environment variable as documented in
      our <a href="advanced-configuration.md">advanced configuration</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <pre><code>import React from &#39;react&#39;;import logo from &#39;./logo.png&#39;; // Tell webpack this JS file uses this imageconsole.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.pngfunction Header() {  // Import result is the URL of your image  return &lt;img src={logo} alt=&quot;Logo&quot; /&gt;;}export default Header;</code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures that when the project is built, webpack will correctly move
      the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.
    </p>
    <p>This works in CSS too:</p>
    <pre><code>.Logo {  background-image: url(./logo.png);}</code></pre>
    <p>
      webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with
      <code>./</code>) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled
      bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you
      will see a compilation error, like when you import a non-existent
      JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are
      generated by webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in
      the future, webpack will give it a different name in production so you
      don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.
    </p>
    <p>Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of webpack.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>It is not required for React</strong> but many people enjoy it
      (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).
    </p>
    <p>
      An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next
      section.
    </p>
    <h2 id="adding-svgs">Adding SVGs</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher, and
        react@16.3.0 and higher.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      One way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also
      import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two
      approaches. In your code it would look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>import { ReactComponent as Logo } from &#39;./logo.svg&#39;;function App() {  return (    &lt;div&gt;      {/* Logo is an actual React component */}      &lt;Logo /&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  );}</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is handy if you don’t want to load SVG as a separate file. Don’t
      forget the curly braces in the import! The
      <code>ReactComponent</code> import name is significant and tells Create
      React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than
      its filename.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Tip: The imported SVG React Component accepts a title prop along with
        other props that a svg element accepts. Use this prop to add an
        accessible title to your svg component.
      </p>
