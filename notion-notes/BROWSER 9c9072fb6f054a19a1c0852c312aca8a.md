# BROWSER

Development: âœ… Used
Production: ðŸš« Ignored
Usage: By default, Create React App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS. Specify a https://github.com/sindresorhus/open#app to override this behavior, or set it to none to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to npm start will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your scriptâ€™s file name must have the .js extension.
