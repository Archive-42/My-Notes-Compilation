      Author(s):Abstract:Managing large amounts of information and efficiently
      using this information in improved decision making has become increasingly
      challenging as businesses collect terabytes of data. Intelligent
      solutions, based on neural networks (NNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs), to
      solve complicated practical problems in various sectors are becoming more
      and more widespread nowadays. The current study provides an overview for
      the operations researcher of the neural networks and genetic algorithms
      methodology, as well as their historical and current use in business. The
      main aim is to present and focus on the wide range of business areas of NN
      and GA applications, avoiding an in‐depth analysis of all the applications
      – with varying success – recorded in the literature. This review reveals
      that, although still regarded as a novel methodology, NN and GA are shown
      to have matured to the point of offering real practical benefits in many
      of their applications.Keywords: Type: Literature reviewPublisher: Emerald
