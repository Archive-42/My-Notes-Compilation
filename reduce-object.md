## Create keyed object from array

<span class="task__importance" title="How important is the task, from 1 to 5">importance: 4</span>

Letâ€™s say we received an array of users in the form `{id:..., name:..., age:... }`.

Create a function `groupById(arr)` that creates an object from it, with `id` as the key, and array items as values.

For example:

    let users = [
      {id: 'john', name: "John Smith", age: 20},
      {id: 'ann', name: "Ann Smith", age: 24},
      {id: 'pete', name: "Pete Peterson", age: 31},
    ];

    let usersById = groupById(users);

    /*
    // after the call we should have:

    usersById = {
      john: {id: 'john', name: "John Smith", age: 20},
      ann: {id: 'ann', name: "Ann Smith", age: 24},
      pete: {id: 'pete', name: "Pete Peterson", age: 31},
    }
    */

Such function is really handy when working with server data.

In this task we assume that `id` is unique. There may be no two array items with the same `id`.

Please use array `.reduce` method in the solution.

solution

    function groupById(array) {
      return array.reduce((obj, value) => {
        obj[value.id] = value;
        return obj;
      }, {})
    }
